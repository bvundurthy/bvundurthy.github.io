I am a Project Scientist at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). My research is dedicated to a fundamental challenge for the future of robotics: 

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>"How can teams of <span style="color: #2596be;"> autonomous robots collaborate </span> and succeed in complex environments, especially when facing <span style="color: #2596be;"> intelligent adversaries</span>?"</i></p>

<!-- "How can teams of <span style="color: #2596be;"> **autonomous robots collaborate** </span> and succeed in complex environments, especially when facing <span style="color: #2596be;"> **intelligent adversaries**</span>?" -->

<!-- **"How can teams of autonomous robots collaborate and succeed in complex environments, especially when facing intelligent adversaries?"** -->

This opposition can take many forms. It might be the environment itself, like a team of drones battling high winds to find survivors in a wildfire. It could be an active adversary, such as a hostile agent jamming a drone's sensors or ambushing an autonomous convoy. Or, it could even come from within a coalition, as agents switch allegiances for individual gain.

To address these challenges, I develop new theoretical foundations for multi-agent systems that are rigorously tested in the real world. My interdisciplinary approach draws from computational geometry, game theory, control theory, and operations research to build a framework centered on three key pillars that I've dubbed **The Three C's of Adversarial Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS)**: 

-   **Constraint:** Optimizing coordination within the robot team against constraints, 
-   **Contention:** Developing strategies to outmaneuver or intercept adversaries, and
-   **Conceit:** Leveraging informational advantages to exploit opponent vulnerabilities.

I am a strong believer in experimental validation, and I actively use both in-house fabricated and commercial autonomous robots to bring my research from theory to practice. Before my time at CMU, I worked at The MathWorks Inc., where I created advanced simulations for autonomous vehicles, including for the Indy-500 oval circuit.

My work has been recognized with best-paper nominations and invitations to special-issue journals. Beyond research, I am deeply passionate about mentoring the next generation of roboticists and was honored to be nominated for CMU's prestigious ‘Andy Award’ for my dedication to student mentorship.
